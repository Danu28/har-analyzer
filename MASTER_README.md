# Master HAR Analyzer

This is a comprehensive HAR (HTTP Archive) file analysis tool that automatically processes HAR files and generates detailed performance reports.

## Features

- **Automated HAR Detection**: Finds all HAR files in the `HAR-Files` folder
- **Interactive Selection**: User-friendly numbered selection interface
- **Complete Analysis Pipeline**: Breaks down HAR files, analyzes performance, and generates reports
- **Professional HTML Reports**: Creates beautiful, interactive HTML reports with charts and insights
- **Organized Output**: Saves reports in the `reports` folder with clean filenames

## Quick Start

1. **Place your HAR files** in the `HAR-Files` folder
2. **Run the master script**:
   ```bash
   python master_har_analyzer.py
   ```
3. **Select a HAR file** from the numbered list
4. **Wait for analysis** to complete (typically 5-10 seconds)
5. **View the report** - it will automatically open in your browser

## What You Get

### Generated Files
- `reports/[filename].html` - Interactive HTML report
- `har_chunks/[filename]/` - Detailed analysis data (auto-cleaned)

### Report Contents
- **Performance Metrics**: Load time, DOM ready time, total requests
- **Critical Issues**: Problems that need immediate attention
- **Recommendations**: Actionable steps to improve performance
- **Resource Breakdown**: Visual charts showing resource distribution
- **Largest Assets**: Files that are impacting performance most
- **Slowest Requests**: Requests taking the longest time
- **Failed Requests**: 404s, 500s, and other errors

## Performance Grading

The tool automatically grades your website's performance:
- **üü¢ GOOD**: Load time < 3 seconds

## Technical Details

The master script orchestrates these individual tools:
1. `scripts/break_har_file.py` - Breaks HAR into analyzable chunks
2. `scripts/analyze_performance.py` - Performs detailed performance analysis
3. `scripts/generate_html_report.py` - Creates interactive HTML reports

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Modern web browser for viewing reports

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Capture Complete HAR Files**: Make sure your HAR includes the full page load
2. **Use Fresh Load**: Clear cache before capturing for accurate "first visit" metrics
3. **Include Network Conditions**: Consider capturing under different network conditions
4. **Mobile vs Desktop**: Analyze both mobile and desktop performance separately

## Troubleshooting

- **No HAR files found**: Ensure `.har` files are in the `HAR-Files` folder
- **Unicode warnings**: These are Windows console display issues and don't affect functionality
- **Large HAR files**: Files over 100MB may take longer to process

## Report Sharing

The generated HTML reports are self-contained and can be:
- Emailed to stakeholders
- Uploaded to internal wikis
- Shared in performance review meetings
- Used for performance tracking over time
